.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Y86
.Pq Dq YES
machine is a theoretical processor based on a subset of x86 concepts.
Being a teaching processor, Y86 embodies elements of both RISC and CISC architectures.
The Y86 machine is a little endian machine consisting of three main components:
memory, program registers, and processor registers.
.Ss Memory
The Y86 memory consists of 1024, 32-bit words.
Addresses generated during program execution are byte addresses
.Pq e.g. the address in the PC .
However, memory can only be accessed with word addresses.
If a byte of data is needed from memory, it is obtaining by first loading the word it's
contained within.
Thus, this simulates a memory system where the
.Em word
is the smallest accessible unit.
.Pp
The relationship between word addresses and byte addresses can be seen below.
